# Handset Hub | An Online Store for Mobile Devices

📝 **Project Description**

**Handset Hub** is a fully functional online store application built for browsing and purchasing mobile phones, tablets, and accessories. The app's design is focused on a clean, modern user interface (UI) to provide a seamless shopping experience.

This project serves as a robust frontend practice project demonstrating proficiency in React component development, complex state management with **TypeScript**, and structured, responsive styling with **SCSS**.

The core features include:

  * Browsing product catalogs for phones, tablets, and accessories.
  * Viewing detailed product pages.
  * Adding and removing items from the shopping cart.
  * Adding and removing items from a "Favorites" list.
  * Filtering and sorting products by price, age, and name.
  * A responsive design that works across desktop and mobile devices.
